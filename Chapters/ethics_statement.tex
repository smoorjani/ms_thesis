\section{Ethics Statement}
\label{sec:ethics}

Our objective for developing controllable stylistic generative language models that leverages domain and audience-specific feedback is to enable unconstrained generation applications to appeal to more human users. For example, generating more persuasive real news might help combat misinformation by propagating the truth faster than falsehoods. In advertising and communication, persuasiveness and memorability are critical traits, and having an unconstrained generation model that could replicate these features would have a multitude of positive applications, especially in targeted interventions. Previous research has focused chiefly on predicting audience characteristics and targeting rather than synthesizing matching messages.

We acknowledge the dual-use concerns of the misuse of such a generation framework to, for example, spread misinformation. For this reason, we do not release the models or the pretrained generator checkpoints used in this work.
