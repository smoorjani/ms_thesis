\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:ctrl_conclusion}

In this chapter, we propose two separate approaches to controllable text generation for complex linguistic features: modifications to the prototype-then-edit framework \citep{guu2018generating} and an adversarial framework with an attribute regressor to control target features. Through various evaluation metrics, we show that both approaches result in fluent, relevant, and controlled generations and propose multiple directions for future work. In the next chapter, we conclude this thesis and discuss the limitations of this thesis as well as the ethical considerations of our work.
