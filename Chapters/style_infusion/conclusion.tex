\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:si_conclusion}

In this chapter, we propose the novel task of \textit{style infusion} to motivate infusing audience-centric, stylistic preferences into unconstrained text generation models. We introduce a bootstrapped data augmentation method to handle limited audience feedback availability and infuse style into GPT-2 via an adversarial training framework. We show that our approach generates compelling stylized examples through traditional metrics and a novel automatic evaluation technique for the transfer of audience-specific styles. In the next chapter, we explore controllable natural language generation techniques to target specific linguistic features strongly correlated with styles like persuasion.
